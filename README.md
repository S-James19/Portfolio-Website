## Portfolio Website

### About

Currently in my second year of university, I am working on developing a portfolio website for myself. 

I decided to build this project as I had never before experienced working with web technologies and I am in a position where I will be looking for work experience, so it seemed to me to be the perfect oppurtunity to build on my current skillset as well as make a project that I can take into the real world.

It is a basic website with a home, about, projects and contact page.

It is currently static, and I am currently working on the javascript and database/server side of the website.

### Technologies Used

To create the website, I have utilized the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
